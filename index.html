      <p class="lead">Not like other couples, Will always give me "weird" nicknames, such as Lucy, Yolanda, Princess, Su Baby, etc. and Little Precious is the one of them.
      </p>
      <p> "Precious" is written “宝” in Chinese. Almost all Chinese characters are created from "simple pictures" and means something, this character means "hidden treasure". And apparently, we are the treasures to each other. We cherish and support each other and are always happy together. And since I am short, of course, I am that "little" precious, and Will is that "big" precious. "Double precious" is our attitude of our love. 
      </p>
      <p><i class="fa fa-glass gold"></i> Please stop by at bar on the wedding day to try our signature cocktail "Double Precious". <span class="label label-success">PROTIP: order two</span></p>

      <h3 id="proposal">Our Romantic Proposal</h3>
      <p class="lead">Will proposed to me in China, my beloved home country on 11/17/2013. That was a total shock. Will didn't give me any hint ahead of time.</p>
      <p>The night before our trip, Will packed all his stuff and went to bed super early since his flight is about 5am the next morning. I was in my room and packing one check-in luggage and one carry-on luggage. Time went by and around 1am, I still had lots of stuff that can't be fit into the luggage. So I opened his luggage and moved stuff around. Who knows, the proposal ring was actually sitting in his "giant" shoe.
      </p>
      <p>When we got to China the first night, he asked me to cancel my dinner plan with friends because he wanted to spend one night with just me in Shanghai, our favorite city in China. We had the dinner at a fancy restaurant, and then he proposed to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_World_Financial_Center" target="_blank">Shanghai world financial center</a>, the supertall skyscraper. This is a very famous building and won lots of awards for architecture. We got there and I noticed that the building has the world's tallest observatory deck. Of course, I told Will that I have to get on the top. The entire building looks so fancy. We got on to the 100th floor and the view was spectacular  Will was also very nice to me. Besides my only selfie pictures, he finally agreed to take pictures for me in different poses. I felt I was living in the heaven. After a while, Will said: "Su, let us find someone to take pictures for us". "Sure, I got someone". I found a Western couple as well and handed them the phone. Here is where the "weirdness" kicked in. Will said to them "we will make some movements, please just keep taking pictures." I was wondering--hmmm, what movements?? Then we did a few stupid poses, Will said "show me your surprised face." I tried my best with the surprised faces, but he still said: "your surprised faces are terrible."  "I think my surprised face is awesome, plus there is really nothing that I can surprise for..." While I was talking, he kneeled down and reached out his pocket. "OMG!!!!!" I can hear my heartbeat at that moment. He took out the ring and opened in front of me, but didn't say anything. I was thinking: hmm..so..do I need to say anything first? but it is not what is showing in the movie??. So I asked him "what should I do now?". Ha! Then he said in Chinese to me: "Will you marry me?". That was definitely the historical moment. I said "YES" without even hesitating. Now I really think I should let him wait there at least for a few second. Bad me. And since his slow motion, which he did on purpose, we also got a few great proposal pictures.
